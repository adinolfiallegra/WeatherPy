WeatherPy

I have created a Python script to analyze the trend based on weather data for 500+ different cities selected randomly based on different values of Latitude and Longitude.

After anlyzed the data provided and sketched the graphs to show the relationship between different properties I can summarized three different assumption:

1. The most reasonable and observable trend of our data is clearly shown on the first graph (latitude-temperature), where we can see that for values of latitude close to 0 (equator) the temperature is increasingly higher. This means that cities very close to the equator are going to be warmer than all the others.

2. For what concern latitude values vs humidity values and latitude values vs  wind seed values,  our data have no specific trends, but we che clearly see that for the first relationship all the data are squeezed in the upper part of the graph (between 60 and 100 percent), on the contrary for the second one the trend of the data is meanly focus on the lower part of the graph (values between 0 and 8 mph)

3.The relationship between latitude and cloudiness shown in the last graph is the only relationship  that has not shown a specific trend or a specific relation between all the data.
